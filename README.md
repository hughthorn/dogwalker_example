# Dog Walker App
## Project Description

An app for dog walkers and their clients, where clients can request a dogwalker by selecting a timeframe available from a walker's appoinment table. Dog walkers can then choose a time that's good for the client and store it in on the appointment table. The client or walker can also delete themselves from the database if they no longer wish to do business.

## User Story
 Iâ€™m a dog walker, and I want to be able to find potential customers and list my available appointment times.

 I'm a dog owner, but I don't have the time to walk my dog every day. I want an app that will allow me to look up available appointments from walkers to take my dog out within the immediate area.

## Code Snippet

    <% include ../../partials/boilerplate %>
    
    <div class="edit">
    <form action="/<%=booked.id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="dog_id" value="<%=booked.dog_id%>" /><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Make Appointment" />
    </form>
    <a href="/"> Back to Main List </a>
    </div>
    
    <% include ../../partials/end %>

This is a snippet from my form edit ejs file (for update) that I was able to figure out on my own, using the Harry Potter homework as a reference.
