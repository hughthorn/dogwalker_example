# Dog Walker App
## Project Description

An app for dog walkers and their clients, where clients can request a dogwalker by selecting a timeframe available from a walker's appoinment table. Dog walkers can then choose a time that's good for the client and store it in on the appointment table. The client or walker can also delete themselves from the database if they no longer wish to do business.
